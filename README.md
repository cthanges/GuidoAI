# GuidoAI

**AI-Powered Race Strategy Analytics**

Real-time analytics tool that uses probabilistic AI to optimize pit strategy, analyze traffic patterns, and predict caution scenarios for racing teams.

## Features

### Race Strategy
- **Optimal Pit Window Calculator**: Multi-lap optimizer that evaluates candidate pit stops and selects the timing that minimizes total race time
- **Traffic & Position Modeling**: Real-time field position tracking with undercut/overcut opportunity detection
- **Probabilistic Caution Analysis**: Expected value calculation across multiple caution timing scenarios with confidence ratings
- **Tyre Degradation Model**: Linear degradation model (configurable seconds/lap) OR auto-detected from telemetry lateral G forces
- **Caution Handler**: Adjusts pit recommendations when yellow flags reduce pit-time cost
- **Interactive Tuning**: Adjust pit cost, degradation rate, target stint, race length, and caution probability via UI controls

### Data Replay
- **Lap-Level Replay**: Step through or auto-replay lap timing data with real-time recommendations
- **Telemetry-Level Replay**: High-frequency sensor data replay (100+ Hz) with lap aggregation
- **Dual Mode Support**: Choose between lap times or telemetry files in UI

### Telemetry Analytics
- **Auto-Degradation Detection**: Estimates tire wear from actual lateral acceleration data
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Alerts for mechanical issues (RPM drops, brake lockups, sensor errors)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detects significant performance drops that may indicate damage

## How It Works

The optimizer evaluates multiple candidate pit laps (e.g., lap 11, 12, 13...) and for each strategy computes:
1. Time remaining on worn tyres before pit
2. Pit time cost
3. Time on fresh tyres after pit (with degradation reset)
4. Total expected race time
5. **Field position changes** (with traffic model enabled)
6. **Undercut/overcut opportunities** based on competitor tire age

It selects the pit lap that minimizes total time and reports the expected time saved vs. no-pit baseline. When traffic modeling is enabled, it also identifies strategic opportunities to gain positions through timing differences.

## How to Run (Local)

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Run tests:

```powershell
pip install pytest
pytest -v
```

## Usage Notes

### Lap Time Mode (Default)
- The app will find lap_time CSV files under `Datasets/` automatically
- Select a file and vehicle ID, then step through laps or run a replay
- Degradation rate is manually configured in sidebar

### Telemetry Mode (Advanced)
1. Select **"Telemetry"** in the Data Type radio button
2. Choose a telemetry CSV file (or it will auto-detect)
3. Select vehicle ID
4. **Degradation is auto-detected** from lateral G forces (early vs late laps)
5. Click **"Run Anomaly Check"** to scan for mechanical issues

### Traffic Model (Optional)
1. Check **"Enable traffic analysis"** in the sidebar
2. Select an endurance analysis CSV file (contains lap-by-lap timing data with `NUMBER`, `LAP_NUMBER`, `ELAPSED` columns)
3. The app will display:
   - Current field position (P1, P2, etc.)
   - Gap to leader and car ahead
   - Expected position change after pit stop
   - Undercut/overcut opportunities with confidence ratings
4. Pit recommendations will highlight undercut opportunities as `reason: 'undercut_opportunity'`

### Sidebar Controls
- **Target stint**: Fallback max stint length (laps)
- **Pit time cost**: Time lost in pit (seconds)
- **Tyre degradation**: Lap time increase per lap (seconds/lap) — auto-detected in telemetry mode
- **Total race laps**: Used to compute remaining laps for optimization window

### Caution Probability (Optional)
1. Check **"Enable caution analysis"** in the sidebar
2. Adjust **"Expected cautions per race"** slider (0.0-5.0, default 2.0)
3. Enable **"Show detailed scenarios"** to see probability distribution
4. The app will display:
   - Recommended strategy (⛽ Pit Now / ⏳ Wait for Caution / 🎯 Optimal Timing)
   - Confidence level (✅ High / ⚠️ Medium / ❌ Low)
   - Expected time savings in seconds
   - Caution probability for next 10 laps (progress bar)
   - Scenario breakdown table (if details enabled)
   - Strategy comparison with expected times
5. The system evaluates three strategies:
   - **Pit Now**: Pay full pit cost, no caution benefit
   - **Wait for Caution**: Gamble on caution coming soon (50% pit cost)
   - **Optimal Timing**: Stick to recommended pit lap
6. Uses probability-weighted expected value across all scenarios
7. Factors in tire degradation cost of waiting vs pit time savings

## Traffic Model

The traffic model reconstructs field positions from lap-by-lap elapsed times and provides strategic insights:

### Key Features
- **Running Order Tracking**: Computes positions, gaps to leader/ahead for each lap
- **Position Estimation**: Predicts field position after pit stops based on expected time loss
- **Undercut Detection**: Identifies cars on older tires vulnerable to undercut strategy
- **Overcut Detection**: Finds opportunities to stay out longer and gain track position
- **Traffic Impact**: Calculates time loss from following other cars

### Data Format
Requires endurance analysis CSV with columns:
- `NUMBER` (or `NUM`): Car number
- `LAP_NUMBER`: Lap number (1-indexed)
- `ELAPSED`: Cumulative race time in `MM:SS.mmm` or `HH:MM:SS.mmm` format

Example:
```
NUMBER; LAP_NUMBER; ELAPSED
13;1;1:40.123
22;1;1:42.456
13;2;3:20.246
22;2;3:24.912
```

### Undercut Logic
An undercut is recommended when:
1. Car ahead is on tires 5+ laps older
2. Expected tire advantage + undercut bonus > gap + pit time loss
3. Confidence based on tire age delta and gap size:
   - **High**: >2s net advantage, >10 laps on tires
   - **Medium**: >1s net advantage, >7 laps on tires
   - **Low**: Marginal advantage

### Integration
The traffic model is optional and can be enabled/disabled in the UI. When enabled, pit recommendations include:
- `field_position`: Current track position (1-20)
- `position_after_pit`: Estimated position after stop
- `undercut_opportunities`: List of strategic targets with confidence ratings
